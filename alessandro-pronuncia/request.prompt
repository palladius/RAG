My son is 7 and is learning German, English, Italian and French. He struggles to pronounce things like German "ie, ei, oe, umlauts" and so on. He also struggles with italian CE/CHE/GI/GHI/CA/CIA and so on. Similarly for french he struggles with vowel dictongues like "au, eau, ll, .." Please create 4 markdown tables which provide THREE values:

problematic "dictongue" or similar assembly of letters

phonetic value for it

one or two example words.

Example for french
oi, ua, voila
