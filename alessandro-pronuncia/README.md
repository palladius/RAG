Okay, this is a great way to help your son! Learning multiple languages at once is fantastic, but yes, the different ways letters combine and sound can be tricky.

Here are four markdown tables, one for each language, focusing on some common pronunciation challenges for young learners. The phonetic descriptions are simplified approximations, often comparing to English sounds where possible, as precise phonetic symbols (IPA) might be too complex at this stage.

**Tips for Practicing:**
*   Say the sounds slowly and clearly yourself.
*   Have him watch your mouth as you make the sounds.
*   Use mirrors so he can see his own mouth position.
*   Make it fun – turn it into a game!
*   Listen to native speakers (songs, simple cartoons).
